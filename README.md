# Breaker Breaker
### A [game](https://bsu-cs315.github.io/FP-Breaker-Breaker/) by Cody Miner and Janardhen Jayavel
## Instructions
Move the paddle left with A or left arrow.
Move the paddle right with d or right arrow.
Pause with escape.
Don't let the ball hit the bottom.
Break every brick!

## Reflection
Our main failure was in our poor time management. We put off the work to the end of Saturday. To fix this, we will add deadlines to individual issues instead of only one deadline for the entire iteration. However, we did do a good job of finding and utilizing outside resources for the few difficulties we had, such as the paddle stopping at the edges of the screen and the deletion of bricks.
